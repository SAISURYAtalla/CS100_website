Six islands in Hawaii attract most of the tourism, including the Island of Hawaii or 'the Big Island,' Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Molokai and Lanai. Honolulu is the Capital city of Hawaii, where most of the tourists head for a Hawaii vacation. Lying in the island of Oahu, this city is the centre of activity and the most densely populated in Hawaii.<br>Hawaii has some of the most beautiful white sand beaches on the planet and Waikiki Beach is one of those. Besides presenting tranquil ambience, this beach offers endless opportunities for surfing and sunbathing.

'The Big Island' is the largest of Hawaiian Islands and is renowned as home to Mauna Loa- one of the most active volcanoes, and Mauna Kea- the tallest sea mountain in the world.

This place is also known for golden sand beaches and a host of beach activities.<br>Kauai, also known as the 'Garden Isle,' is home to some of the most sought-after places in all of Hawaii. Oldest of the islands here, it boasts of awe-inspiring natural wonders of Waimea Canyon and the Na Pali Coast. It is blessed with miles and miles of unmatched sand beaches, attracting a number of tourists. Poipu, lying on the south side of this island, is termed the 'sunny side of the paradise.'

The site is now home to several attractions that are part of the World War II Valor in the Pacific Monument, including the USS Arizona Memorial, which floats above the remains of the sunken ship - parts of which can be seen protruding from the water. There is no cost for a tour of the memorial, however reservations are recommended due to its popularity.<br>The Pearl Harbor Visitor Center has free admission and is the meeting place for tours, including transportation to the Pacific Aviation Museum on Ford Island, where visitors can see WWII aircraft and artifacts, as well as experience landing an airplane on an aircraft carrier in a flight simulator.<br>Other attractions include the USS Oklahoma, USS Utah, and the Battleship USS Missouri whose deck can be toured by visitors.</p>

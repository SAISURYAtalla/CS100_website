			<h2>Welcome to Swiss Alps</h2>
			<p>Discover the beauty and charm of Swiss Alps .A magnet for skiers and hikers, these dramatic peaks - including the iconic Matterhorn - range from 3,000 to 15,000 feet and spread across three-fifths of the country. Abundant glaciers, scenic valleys and gorgeous alpine lakes add to the region's visual appeal. The Glacier Express train travels the 7.5-hour route through the Swiss Alps from Zermatt to St. Moritz, passing through fairy-tale villages and over 291 bridges along the way</p>

			<h2>Top Attractions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>The Matterhorn</h3>
					<img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/13/e4/fd/the-matterhorn.jpg?w=1200&h=-1&s=1" alt="The Matterhorn" width=300 height=200>
					<p>Recognized worldwide as the mountain on the Toblerone chocolate bar, the Matterhorn sits on the Switzerland-Italy border. Enjoy magnificent views of the mountain from Zermatt, a quaint car-free village; or from the top of Gornergrat, where you'll find viewing platforms, a short Scenic Loop hike, and a virtual reality paragliding experience. If you're an early riser, don't miss the chance to take the first train up to Riffelsee, and snap a picture of the Matterhorn together with its reflection in a lake. <br>Even better, have an aerial view from above on a helicopter tour, or check out the best spots on a guided day hike. </p>

					<h3>Lake Lugano</h3>

					<p>Lake Lugano is a scenic lake that stretches across Switzerland and Northern Italy. The best way to fully appreciate its stunning views is by taking a boat cruise, where you can enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. A popular excursion is a boat ride to Morcote or Gandria, two quaint fishing villages along the lake. For a bird's-eye view, hop on the funicular from Lugano City. <br>During the summer, you can even rent a paddle boat or go windsurfing. Alternatively, take a leisure stroll along the tree-lined promenade that runs alongside the lake.</p>

					<h3>Gornergrat</h3>

					<p>The Gornergrat (3,089 m) is one of those places that everyone should visit at least once in a lifetime. The mountain panorama and the glorious view of the Matterhorn are unforgettable. With its sunny observation platform accessible all year, the Gornergrat, at an altitude of 3,089 m, has been one of Switzerland’s top excursion destinations since 1898. The Gornergrat Bahn was the world’s first fully electrified cog railway. Today it is a modern, eco-friendly railway, equipped with a regenerative braking system that generates electricity on the descent and so saves energy.</p>

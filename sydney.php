					<h3>Sydney Harbour Bridge</h3>

					<p>The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a colossal structure which took the efforts of over 1400 workers and a time span of 8 years. The bridge was put together using over 6 million hand-driven rivets into 53,000 tonnes of steel, thus completing the construction of the world's largest steel arch Bridge. A unique fact about this bridge is that it is continuously being painted mostly to protect it from outer elements and due to its humongous size by the time the painting is done it is time to start over and this cycle is unending. The steel arch of the Bridge actually changes in size; sometimes up-to 18 cm change in its height can be seen. The Bridge's workers and caretakers once included the famous Australian Actor Paul Hogan as a rigger and his job was to erect platforms so the painters could come.<br>The arch of the Bridge is open to climbing and has had over 3 million visitors since 1998 that came for this adventurous trip. The view from the top of the arch is mesmerizing and unbeatable. Approximately 80 % of the steel used in the bridge was actually imported from the United Kingdom and this means that the steel has traveled halfway across the world to make this bridge. </p>
